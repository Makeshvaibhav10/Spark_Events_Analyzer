IDENTIFIED BOTTLENECKS (4)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Memory Spill to Disk [CRITICAL] - Confidence: 100%
   Impact: 1.52 GB spilled to disk (71.8% of input data)
   Probable Cause: Insufficient executor memory causing data spill. Supporting Evidence: 1.52 GB spilled to memory, 1.25 GB spilled to disk (71.8% of input data). Indicates memory pressure requiring incr...

2. GC Overhead / Memory Pressure [HIGH] - Confidence: 94%
   Impact: GC consumes 24.2% of executor runtime, causing performance degradation
   Probable Cause: Memory pressure due to high garbage collection overhead. Supporting Evidence: GC consumes 24.2% of executor runtime, 1.52 GB spilled to disk (strong correlation: 0.99). Confidence base...

3. Data Skew / Partition Imbalance [HIGH] - Confidence: 90%
   Impact: Task duration variance is 91.3% of mean, with 0.0% straggler tasks
   Probable Cause: Data skew causing uneven partition distribution. Supporting Evidence: Task duration variance is 91.3% of mean, 0.0% of tasks are stragglers. P99 task is 1.9x slower than median. Indica...

4. CPU Underutilization / CPU Underutilization [HIGH] - Confidence: 80%
   Impact: CPUs are 64.0% idle, indicating inefficient resource utilization
   Probable Cause: CPU underutilization with 64.0% CPU idle time. Supporting Evidence: CPU efficiency is 36.0%. Low CPU utilization without I/O pressure suggests serialization overhead or insufficient pa...
